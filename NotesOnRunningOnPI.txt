setup LD_LIBRARY_PATH to path containing all frc .so files. for example:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/frc/lib/

compile the java file into a class using javac command, for example:

javac -cp /usr/local/frc/java/ntcore.jar  NetworkTablesDesktopClient.java 

NOTE: only include the jar files you need to cover the import statements in the java file. ie you cannot use /usr/.../jave/*

to run the java program use java as such:

java -cp .:/usr/local/frc/java/* NetworkTablesDesktopClient

this will find the main(args) function in the last name class specified by the last argument (NetworkTablesDesktopClient). BUT you must include the path (relative or full) to the .class file.

NOTE: here you need to specify all referenced java classes in the -cp, fortunately you can use a wildcard in the -cp. don't forget to include the path to the main class file

i uploaded the raspberry PI wpilib libraries (java and so) to the AndromedaOneSoftwareTeam google drive in a tgz file.
